# Download and Install Packet Tracer


This video will show you how to download and install Packet Tracer. You will use Packet Tracer to simulate creating and testing networks on your computer. Packet Tracer is a fun, take-home, flexible software program that will give you the opportunity to use the network representations and theories that you have just learned to build network models and explore relatively complex LANs and WANs.

Students commonly use Packet Tracer to:

Prepare for a certification exam.
Practice what they learn in networking courses.
Sharpen their skills for a job interview.
Examine the impact of adding new technologies into existing network designs.
Build their skills for jobs in the Internet of Things.
Compete in Global Design Challenges (take a look at the 2017 PT 7 Design Challenge on Facebook).
Packet Tracer is an essential learning tool used in many Cisco Networking Academy courses.

To obtain and install your copy of Cisco Packet Tracer follow these steps:

Step 1. Log into your Cisco Networking Academy “I'm Learning” page.
Step 2. Select Resources.
Step 3. Select Download Packet Tracer.
Step 4. Select the version of Packet Tracer you require.
Step 5. Save the file to your computer.
Step 6. Launch the Packet Tracer install program.

Click Play in the video for a detailed walk-through of the Packet Tracer download and installation process.
